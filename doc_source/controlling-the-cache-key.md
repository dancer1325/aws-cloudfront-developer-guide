## Creating cache policies<a name="cache-key-create-cache-policy"></a>

* TODO:
You can use a cache policy to improve your cache hit ratio by controlling the values \(URL query strings, HTTP headers, and cookies\) that are included in the cache key\. You can create a cache policy in the CloudFront console, with the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), or with the CloudFront API\.

After you create a cache policy, you attach it to one or more cache behaviors in a CloudFront distribution\.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To create a cache policy \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the **Policies** page in the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home?#/policies](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home?#/policies)\.

1. Choose **Create cache policy**\.

1. Choose the desired setting for this cache policy\. For more information, see [Understanding cache policies](#cache-key-understand-cache-policy)\.

1. When finished, choose **Create**\.

After you create a cache policy, you can attach it to a cache behavior\.

**To attach a cache policy to an existing distribution \(console\)**

1. Open the **Distributions** page in the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home#/distributions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home#/distributions)\.

1. Choose the distribution to update, then choose the **Behaviors** tab\.

1. Choose the cache behavior to update, then choose **Edit**\.

   Or, to create a new cache behavior, choose **Create behavior**\.

1. In the **Cache key and origin requests** section, make sure that **Cache policy and origin request policy** is chosen\.

1. For **Cache policy**, choose the cache policy to attach to this cache behavior\.

1. At the bottom of the page, choose **Save changes**\.

**To attach a cache policy to a new distribution \(console\)**

1. Open the CloudFront console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home)\.

1. Choose **Create distribution**\.

1. In the **Cache key and origin requests** section, make sure that **Cache policy and origin request policy** is chosen\.

1. For **Cache policy**, choose the cache policy to attach to this distribution's default cache behavior\.

1. Choose the desired settings for the origin, default cache behavior, and other distribution settings\. For more information, see [Values that you specify when you create or update a distribution](distribution-web-values-specify.md)\.

1. When finished, choose **Create distribution**\.

------
#### [ CLI ]

To create a cache policy with the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), use the aws cloudfront create\-cache\-policy command\. You can use an input file to provide the command's input parameters, rather than specifying each individual parameter as command line input\.

**To create a cache policy \(CLI with input file\)**

1. Use the following command to create a file named `cache-policy.yaml` that contains all of the input parameters for the create\-cache\-policy command\.

   ```
   aws cloudfront create-cache-policy --generate-cli-skeleton yaml-input > cache-policy.yaml
   ```

1. Open the file named `cache-policy.yaml` that you just created\. Edit the file to specify the cache policy settings that you want, then save the file\. You can remove optional fields from the file, but don't remove the required fields\.

   For more information about the cache policy settings, see [Understanding cache policies](#cache-key-understand-cache-policy)\.

1. Use the following command to create the cache policy using input parameters from the `cache-policy.yaml` file\.

   ```
   aws cloudfront create-cache-policy --cli-input-yaml file://cache-policy.yaml
   ```

   Make note of the `Id` value in the command's output\. This is the cache policy ID, and you need it to attach the cache policy to a CloudFront distribution's cache behavior\.

**To attach a cache policy to an existing distribution \(CLI with input file\)**

1. Use the following command to save the distribution configuration for the CloudFront distribution that you want to update\. Replace *distribution\_ID* with the distribution's ID\.

   ```
   aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id distribution_ID --output yaml > dist-config.yaml
   ```

1. Open the file named `dist-config.yaml` that you just created\. Edit the file, making the following changes to each cache behavior that you are updating to use a cache policy\.
   + In the cache behavior, add a field named `CachePolicyId`\. For the field's value, use the cache policy ID that you noted after creating the policy\.
   + Remove the `MinTTL`, `MaxTTL`, `DefaultTTL`, and `ForwardedValues` fields from the cache behavior\. These settings are specified in the cache policy, so you can't include these fields and a cache policy in the same cache behavior\.
   + Rename the `ETag` field to `IfMatch`, but don't change the field's value\.

   Save the file when finished\.

1. Use the following command to update the distribution to use the cache policy\. Replace *distribution\_ID* with the distribution's ID\.

   ```
   aws cloudfront update-distribution --id distribution_ID --cli-input-yaml file://dist-config.yaml
   ```

**To attach a cache policy to a new distribution \(CLI with input file\)**

1. Use the following command to create a file named `distribution.yaml` that contains all of the input parameters for the create\-distribution command\.

   ```
   aws cloudfront create-distribution --generate-cli-skeleton yaml-input > distribution.yaml
   ```

1. Open the file named `distribution.yaml` that you just created\. In the default cache behavior, in the `CachePolicyId` field, enter the cache policy ID that you noted after creating the policy\. Continue editing the file to specify the distribution settings that you want, then save the file when finished\.

   For more information about the distribution settings, see [Values that you specify when you create or update a distribution](distribution-web-values-specify.md)\.

1. Use the following command to create the distribution using input parameters from the `distribution.yaml` file\.

   ```
   aws cloudfront create-distribution --cli-input-yaml file://distribution.yaml
   ```

------
#### [ API ]

To create a cache policy with the CloudFront API, use [CreateCachePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCachePolicy.html)\. For more information about the fields that you specify in this API call, see [Understanding cache policies](#cache-key-understand-cache-policy) and the API reference documentation for your AWS SDK or other API client\.

After you create a cache policy, you can attach it to a cache behavior, using one of the following API calls:
+ To attach it to a cache behavior in an existing distribution, use [UpdateDistribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html)\.
+ To attach it to a cache behavior in a new distribution, use [CreateDistribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDistribution.html)\.

For both of these API calls, provide the cache policy's ID in the `CachePolicyId` field, inside a cache behavior\. For more information about the other fields that you specify in these API calls, see [Values that you specify when you create or update a distribution](distribution-web-values-specify.md) and the API reference documentation for your AWS SDK or other API client\.

## Understanding cache policies<a name="cache-key-understand-cache-policy"></a>

You can use a cache policy to improve your cache hit ratio by controlling the values \(URL query strings, HTTP headers, and cookies\) that are included in the cache key\. CloudFront provides some predefined cache policies, known as *managed policies*, for common use cases\. You can use these managed policies, or you can create your own cache policy that's specific to your needs\. For more information about the managed policies, see [Using the managed cache policies](using-managed-cache-policies.md)\.

A cache policy contains the following settings, which are categorized into *policy information*, *time to live \(TTL\) settings*, and *cache key settings*\.

### Policy information<a name="cache-key-understand-cache-policy-info"></a>

**Name**  
A name to identify the cache policy\. In the console, you use the name to attach the cache policy to a cache behavior\.

**Description**  
A comment to describe the cache policy\. This is optional, but it can help you identify the purpose of the cache policy\.

### Time to live \(TTL\) settings<a name="cache-key-understand-cache-policy-ttl"></a>

The time to live \(TTL\) settings work together with the `Cache-Control` and `Expires` HTTP headers \(if they're in the origin response\) to determine how long objects in the CloudFront cache remain valid\.

**Minimum TTL**  
The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront checks with the origin to see if the object has been updated\. For more information, see [Managing how long content stays in the cache \(expiration\)](Expiration.md)\.

**Maximum TTL**  
The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront checks with the origin to see if the object has been updated\. CloudFront uses this setting only when the origin sends `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers with the object\. For more information, see [Managing how long content stays in the cache \(expiration\)](Expiration.md)\.

**Default TTL**  
The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront checks with the origin to see if the object has been updated\. CloudFront uses this setting's value as the object's TTL only when the origin does *not* send `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers with the object\. For more information, see [Managing how long content stays in the cache \(expiration\)](Expiration.md)\.

### Cache key settings<a name="cache-key-understand-cache-policy-settings"></a>

Cache key settings specify the values in viewer requests that CloudFront includes in the cache key\. The values can include URL query strings, HTTP headers, and cookies\. The values that you include in the cache key are automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin, known as *origin requests*\. For information about controlling origin requests without affecting the cache key, see [Controlling origin requests](controlling-origin-requests.md)\.

Cache key settings include:
+ [Headers](#cache-policy-headers)
+ [Cookies](#cache-policy-cookies)
+ [Query strings](#cache-policy-query-strings)
+ [Compression support](#cache-policy-compressed-objects)

**Headers**  
The HTTP headers in viewer requests that CloudFront includes in the cache key and in origin requests\. For headers, you can choose one of the following settings:  
+ **None** â€“ The HTTP headers in viewer requests are *not* included in the cache key and are *not* automatically included in origin requests\.
+ **Include the following headers** â€“ You specify which of the HTTP headers in viewer requests are included in the cache key and automatically included in origin requests\.
When you use the **Include the following headers** setting, you specify HTTP headers by their name, not their value\. For example, consider the following HTTP header:  

```
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
```
In this case, you specify the header as `Accept-Language`, not as `Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5`\. However, CloudFront includes the full header, including its value, in the cache key and in origin requests\.  
You can also include certain headers generated by CloudFront in the cache key\. For more information, see [Adding CloudFront request headers](adding-cloudfront-headers.md)\.

**Cookies**  
The cookies in viewer requests that CloudFront includes in the cache key and in origin requests\. For cookies, you can choose one of the following settings:  
+ **None** â€“ The cookies in viewer requests are *not* included in the cache key and are *not* automatically included in origin requests\.
+ **All** â€“ All cookies in viewer requests are included in the cache key and are automatically included in origin requests\.
+ **Include specified cookies** â€“ You specify which of the cookies in viewer requests are included in the cache key and automatically included in origin requests\.
+ **Include all cookies except** â€“ You specify which of the cookies in viewer requests are *not* included in the cache key and are *not* automatically included in origin requests\. All other cookies, except for the ones you specify, *are* included in the cache key and automatically included in origin requests\.
When you use the **Include specified cookies** or **Include all cookies except** setting, you specify cookies by their name, not their value\. For example, consider the following `Cookie` header:  

```
Cookie: session_ID=abcd1234
```
In this case, you specify the cookie as `session_ID`, not as `session_ID=abcd1234`\. However, CloudFront includes the full cookie, including its value, in the cache key and in origin requests\.

**Query strings**  
The URL query strings in viewer requests that CloudFront includes in the cache key and in origin requests\. For query strings, you can choose one of the following settings:  
+ **None** â€“ The query strings in viewer requests are *not* included in the cache key and are *not* automatically included in origin requests\.
+ **All** â€“ All query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key and are also automatically included in origin requests\.
+ **Include specified query strings** â€“ You specify which of the query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key and automatically included in origin requests\.
+ **Include all query strings except** â€“ You specify which of the query strings in viewer requests are *not* included in the cache key and are *not* automatically included in origin requests\. All other query strings, except for the ones you specify, *are* included in the cache key and automatically included in origin requests\.
When you use the **Include specified query strings** or **Include all query strings except** setting, you specify query strings by their name, not their value\. For example, consider the following URL path:  

```
/content/stories/example-story.html?split-pages=false
```
In this case, you specify the query string as `split-pages`, not as `split-pages=false`\. However, CloudFront includes the full query string, including its value, in the cache key and in origin requests\.

**Compression support**  
These settings enable CloudFront to request and cache objects that are compressed in the Gzip or Brotli compression formats, when the viewer supports it\. These settings also allow [CloudFront compression](ServingCompressedFiles.md) to work\. Viewers indicate their support for these compression formats with the `Accept-Encoding` HTTP header\.  
The Chrome and Firefox web browsers support Brotli compression only when the request is sent using HTTPS\. These browsers do not support Brotli with HTTP requests\.
Enable these settings when any of the following are true:  
+ Your origin returns Gzip compressed objects when viewers support them \(requests contain the `Accept-Encoding` HTTP header with `gzip` as a value\)\. In this case, use the **Gzip enabled** setting \(set `EnableAcceptEncodingGzip` to `true` in the CloudFront API, AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation\)\.
+ Your origin returns Brotli compressed objects when viewers support them \(requests contain the `Accept-Encoding` HTTP header with `br` as a value\)\. In this case, use the **Brotli enabled** setting \(set `EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli` to `true` in the CloudFront API, AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation\)\.
+ The cache behavior that this cache policy is attached to is configured with [CloudFront compression](ServingCompressedFiles.md)\. In this case, you can enable caching for either Gzip or Brotli, or both\. When CloudFront compression is enabled, enabling caching for both formats can help to reduce your costs for data transfer out to the internet\.
If you enable caching for one or both of these compression formats, do not include the `Accept-Encoding` header in an [origin request policy](controlling-origin-requests.md) that's associated with the same cache behavior\. CloudFront always includes this header in origin requests when caching is enabled for either of these formats, so including `Accept-Encoding` in an origin request policy has no effect\.
If your origin server does not return Gzip or Brotli compressed objects, or the cache behavior is not configured with CloudFront compression, don't enable caching for compressed objects\. If you do, it might cause a decrease in your [cache hit ratio](cache-hit-ratio.md)\.  
The following explains how these settings affect a CloudFront distribution\. All of the following scenarios assume that the viewer request includes the `Accept-Encoding` header\. When the viewer request does not include the `Accept-Encoding` header, CloudFront doesn't include this header in the cache key and doesn't include it in the corresponding origin request\.    
**When caching compressed objects is enabled for both compression formats**  
If the viewer supports both Gzip and Brotliâ€”that is, if the `gzip` and `br` values are both in the `Accept-Encoding` header in the viewer requestâ€”CloudFront does the following:  
+ Normalizes the header to `Accept-Encoding: br,gzip` and includes the normalized header in the cache key\. The cache key doesn't include other values that were in the `Accept-Encoding` header sent by the viewer\.
+ If the edge location has a Brotli or Gzip compressed object in the cache that matches the request and is not expired, the edge location returns the object to the viewer\.
+ If the edge location doesn't have a Brotli or Gzip compressed object in the cache that matches the request and is not expired, CloudFront includes the normalized header \(`Accept-Encoding: br,gzip`\) in the corresponding origin request\. The origin request doesn't include other values that were in the `Accept-Encoding` header sent by the viewer\.
If the viewer supports one compression format but not the otherâ€”for example, if `gzip` is a value in the `Accept-Encoding` header in the viewer request but `br` is notâ€”CloudFront does the following:  
+ Normalizes the header to `Accept-Encoding: gzip` and includes the normalized header in the cache key\. The cache key doesn't include other values that were in the `Accept-Encoding` header sent by the viewer\.
+ If the edge location has a Gzip compressed object in the cache that matches the request and is not expired, the edge location returns the object to the viewer\.
+ If the edge location doesn't have a Gzip compressed object in the cache that matches the request and is not expired, CloudFront includes the normalized header \(`Accept-Encoding: gzip`\) in the corresponding origin request\. The origin request doesn't include other values that were in the `Accept-Encoding` header sent by the viewer\.
To understand what CloudFront does if the viewer supports Brotli but not Gzip, replace the two compression formats with each other in the preceding example\.  
If the viewer does not support Brotli or Gzipâ€”that is, the `Accept-Encoding` header in the viewer request does not contain `br` or `gzip` as valuesâ€”CloudFront:  
+ Doesn't include the `Accept-Encoding` header in the cache key\.
+ Includes `Accept-Encoding: identity` in the corresponding origin request\. The origin request doesn't include other values that were in the `Accept-Encoding` header sent by the viewer\.  
**When caching compressed objects is enabled for one compression format, but not the other**  
If the viewer supports the format for which caching is enabledâ€”for example, if caching compressed objects is enabled for Gzip and the viewer supports Gzip \(`gzip` is one of the values in the `Accept-Encoding` header in the viewer request\)â€”CloudFront does the following:  
+ Normalizes the header to `Accept-Encoding: gzip` and includes the normalized header in the cache key\.
+ If the edge location has a Gzip compressed object in the cache that matches the request and is not expired, the edge location returns the object to the viewer\.
+ If the edge location doesn't have a Gzip compressed object in the cache that matches the request and is not expired, CloudFront includes the normalized header \(`Accept-Encoding: gzip`\) in the corresponding origin request\. The origin request doesn't include other values that were in the `Accept-Encoding` header sent by the viewer\.
This behavior is the same when the viewer supports both Gzip and Brotli \(the `Accept-Encoding` header in the viewer request includes both `gzip` *and* `br` as values\), because in this scenario, caching compressed objects for Brotli is not enabled\.  
To understand what CloudFront does if caching compressed objects is enabled for Brotli but not Gzip, replace the two compression formats with each other in the preceding example\.  
If the viewer does not support the compression format for which caching is enabled \(the `Accept-Encoding` header in the viewer request doesn't contain the value for that format\), CloudFront:  
+ Doesn't include the `Accept-Encoding` header in the cache key\.
+ Includes `Accept-Encoding: identity` in the corresponding origin request\. The origin request doesn't include other values that were in the `Accept-Encoding` header sent by the viewer\.  
**When caching compressed objects is disabled for both compression formats**  
When caching compressed objects is disabled for both compression formats, CloudFront treats the `Accept-Encoding` header the same as any other HTTP header in the viewer request\. By default, it's not included in the cache key and it's not included in origin requests\. You can include it in the headers list in a cache policy or an origin request policy the same as any other HTTP header\.
